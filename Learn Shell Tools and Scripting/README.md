# Learn Shell Tools and Scripting

This document contains all data related to Terminal and scripting.

## [1 - Learn Shell Tools](./docs/Learn-Shell-Tools.md)

In this section, you will explore the fundamental shell tools used in Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and macOS. These tools are essential for interacting with the command-line interface efficiently. Some key topics covered in this section include:

- Basic commands: Learn essential commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `pwd`, `cat`, `grep`.
- File system navigation: Understand how to navigate through directories, list files and directories, create new directories, and remove files and directories.
- File management: Learn how to manage files, including copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories.
- Redirection and pipes: Understand how to redirect input and output streams and use pipes to combine multiple commands.

## [2 - Learn Scripting](./docs/Learn-Scripting.md)

In this section, you will dive into scripting languages commonly used in Unix-like environments, particularly the shell scripting language (bash). Shell scripting allows you to automate tasks and create powerful scripts to streamline your workflow. Key topics covered in this section include:

- Introduction to shell scripting: Understand the basics of shell scripting, including variables, control structures (if statements, loops), and functions.
- Writing shell scripts: Learn how to write and execute shell scripts using a text editor, including creating executable scripts, passing arguments to scripts, and handling user input.
- Scripting best practices: Explore best practices for writing maintainable and efficient shell scripts, including code organization, error handling, and documentation.
- Advanced scripting techniques: Dive into more advanced shell scripting topics, such as working with arrays, handling signals, and interacting with system commands and processes.
- Scripting examples: Study real-world examples of shell scripts to solve common tasks, automate system administration tasks, and perform complex data processing tasks.

By exploring these topics, you will gain a solid understanding of shell tools and scripting, empowering you to efficiently work with the command line and automate tasks in Unix-like environments.
